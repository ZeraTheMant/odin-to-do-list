# odin-to-do-list

my submission for the to-do list project of the Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list

see live version at https://zerathemant.github.io/odin-to-do-list/

**important** i lifted the design from Amadou Ibrahim and Arafat akata (https://github.com/tigamadou/todoapp/), I was short on time and needed to work on practicing modules and factories so i couldn't spend much time worrying about the design so i just selected one from the recent project submissions that i liked the most..
**i did not copy any code from their project though, just the design of the UI, i copied everything by sight and coded the CSS from scratch**
